# Rapidream + NextJS

This is an boilerplate of [Rapidream](https://rapidream.com) installed into a default [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the rapidream cli:

```bash

# or
npm run rapidream
```

Then, in another terminal, start the NextJS development server:
